          Hi, I'm Rahul, A Computer Science Engineer. I have completed my graduation in 2020. I am very passionate about programming. Programming has
          become the most crucial part of my life. Like as much as food is necessary for living, programming is also necessary for me to live. I like
          solving daily life problems with the help of programming.

          Because of Covid-19, I lost my whole year, but I was learning new technologies online during the pandemic. I never stopped myself from
          learning. In mid-2021 the situation became a little bit better, so I decided to apply for a job, and I got one, I did that job for almost 6
          months. But suddenly my father got some health issue and had to come to the home. This is my journey from graduation to mid-2022, in short.
